# Masterplan
1. Train transformer on translation tasks for fixed number of epochs
2. Apply pruning algorithms
3. Analyze BLEU score before and after pruning

# To Do - Beginning
* [x] Integrate Encoder, Decoder, Seq2Seq Model
* [x] Add Multimodal Translation Dataset (WMT16 Multi30k Dataset)
* [x] Add BLEU Metric
* [x] Add Training and Evaluation Loop
* [ ] Add WMT16 News (Developement) Dataset
